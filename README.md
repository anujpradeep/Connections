  Input username and password and the other user's username that you want to connect with, then select the platforms that you wish to 
  connnect on.

  Notes:  
    
   Prototype Overview:
    Only works so far for Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Assumes the user is already registered in data base (text file).
    
   Future Plans: 
      To create a fully functioning website that can register new users and save their information to the cloud. Then be able to access           that information from the cloud instead of the text file. To actually use the page elements instead of using tab presses and enter 
      presses. Also wish to expand to more platforms. Also wish to include some kind of cyber security.
